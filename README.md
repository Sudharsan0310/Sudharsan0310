# Hi there, I'm Sudharsan J S 👋

## 🚀 Python & Django Backend Developer | REST API 

💼 **Fresh BCA Graduate | Actively Seeking Backend Developer Role**

Backend developer specializing in Django and Python. In 7 months, I've built and deployed three production applications – a blogging platform, real-time chat system, and REST API. I learn by doing, not just by studying., I've transformed from a curious beginner to building and deploying three production-ready applications. Every project taught me something new, every bug made me stronger, and every deployment gave me confidence.

I don't just write code – I craft solutions. And I'm ready to bring that same dedication to a team that values growth, innovation, and impact.

## 💭 My Journey

After graduating in June 2025, I chose backend development over the traditional path. Best decision I ever made.

**The last 7 months:**
- Started with Python basics – felt overwhelming, stayed determined
- Built my first Django app – messy but working. I was hooked
- Struggled with databases, then mastered them
- Deployed my first app – seeing it live was surreal
- Tackled WebSockets – complexity challenged me, but I persisted
- Mastered REST APIs with DRF – everything clicked

**Three deployed projects later**, I'm not just another fresher with certificates. I'm someone who:
- Builds applications that real users access
- Debugs and fixes production issues
- Understands databases, APIs, and deployment
- Writes clean code I'd proudly show any senior developer


**I'm not looking for just any job – I'm looking for a team that will challenge me, mentor me, and let me prove that dedication beats experience when paired with the right guidance.**

## 💬 A Personal Note

If you're a recruiter or hiring manager reading this, thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey. I know I'm a fresher, and I know there are candidates with more years of experience. But what I lack in years, I make up for in dedication, curiosity, and the proven ability to learn and deliver.

**I'm not asking for a favor – I'm offering value.** Give me a problem, and I'll solve it. Give me a codebase, and I'll understand it. Give me a mentor, and I'll absorb everything they teach me.

I've spent the last 7 months proving to myself that I can build real applications. Now I'm ready to prove it to a team that believes in potential as much as experience.

**Let's build something amazing together.** 🚀
